### 3. Agent Interaction Patterns
```markdown
# Agent Interaction Patterns Catalog

## Pattern 1: Pipeline Processing

### Description
Sequential processing where each agent adds value to the work product.

### Example: Documentation Pipeline
```yaml
pipeline: comprehensive-documentation
stages:
  - stage: analysis
    agent: codebase-analyzer
    output: architecture-report.md
    
  - stage: technical-docs
    agent: technical-documentation-writer
    input: architecture-report.md
    output: technical-guide.md
    
  - stage: business-docs
    agent: business-documentation-writer
    input: technical-guide.md
    output: user-guide.md
    
  - stage: optimization
    agent: documentation-writer
    input: [technical-guide.md, user-guide.md]
    output: unified-docs.md
```

## Pattern 2: Parallel Specialization

### Description
Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects of the same problem.

### Example: Release Preparation
```yaml
parallel-execution: release-prep
agents:
  - name: security-scanner
    task: security-audit
    timeout: 30min
    
  - name: integration-test-writer
    task: e2e-test-creation
    timeout: 45min
    
  - name: technical-documentation-writer
    task: release-notes
    timeout: 20min
    
  - name: performance-optimizer
    task: performance-audit
    timeout: 25min

aggregator: product-roadmap-planner
final-output: release-readiness-report.md
```

## Pattern 3: Hierarchical Delegation

### Description
Lead agent coordinates specialist agents based on task requirements.

### Example: Platform Redesign
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[platform-redesigner] --> B[ux-optimizer]
    A --> C[visual-design-enhancer]
    A --> D[performance-optimizer]
    B --> E[user-research-tasks]
    C --> F[design-tasks]
    D --> G[optimization-tasks]
    A --> H[Integrated Solution]
```

### Implementation
```python
class PlatformRedesignOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lead = "platform-redesigner"
        self.specialists = {
            "ux": "ux-optimizer",
            "visual": "visual-design-enhancer", 
            "performance": "performance-optimizer"
        }
    
    def execute_redesign(self, requirements):
        # Lead analyzes requirements
        analysis = self.agents[self.lead].analyze(requirements)
        
        # Parallel specialist execution
        tasks = []
        for domain, agent in self.specialists.items():
            if domain in analysis.needed_expertise:
                tasks.append(
                    self.agents[agent].execute(analysis.subtasks[domain])
                )
        
        # Aggregate results
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return self.agents[self.lead].integrate(results)
```

## Pattern 4: Event-Driven Collaboration

### Description
Agents react to events and trigger other agents based on outcomes.

### Example: Continuous Improvement Loop
```yaml
event-system: continuous-improvement
events:
  - name: code-committed
    triggers:
      - agent: code-reviewer
        condition: always
      - agent: unit-test-writer
        condition: if-no-tests
      - agent: security-scanner
        condition: if-security-files
        
  - name: review-completed
    triggers:
      - agent: code-refactorer
        condition: if-improvements-suggested
      - agent: documentation-writer
        condition: if-api-changed
        
  - name: performance-degradation
    triggers:
      - agent: performance-optimizer
        condition: if-threshold-exceeded
      - agent: codebase-analyzer
        condition: if-systemic-issue
```

## Pattern 5: Consensus Building

### Description
Multiple agents provide input for collective decision-making.

### Example: Feature Prioritization
```yaml
consensus-process: feature-prioritization
participants:
  - agent: product-roadmap-planner
    weight: 0.3
    perspective: business-value
    
  - agent: codebase-analyzer
    weight: 0.2
    perspective: technical-feasibility
    
  - agent: ux-optimizer
    weight: 0.2
    perspective: user-impact
    
  - agent: performance-optimizer
    weight: 0.15
    perspective: system-impact
    
  - agent: security-scanner
    weight: 0.15
    perspective: security-risk

voting-mechanism: weighted-average
decision-threshold: 0.7
output: prioritized-feature-list.md
```
```

## Capability Overlaps and Gaps

### Overlap Analysis
**Documentation Overlap**:
- `documentation-writer` ↔ `technical-documentation-writer` ↔ `business-documentation-writer`
- Resolution: Clear scope boundaries by audience

**Testing Overlap**:
- `unit-test-writer` ↔ `integration-test-writer` ↔ `test-runner`
- Resolution: Layer-specific responsibilities

### Identified Gaps
1. **Data Management**: No dedicated data migration/ETL agent
2. **Monitoring**: No observability/monitoring agent
3. **Deployment**: No deployment automation agent
4. **Communication**: No stakeholder communication agent

### Recommended New Agents
1. **data-pipeline-architect**: ETL, migrations, data quality
2. **observability-engineer**: Monitoring, alerting, dashboards
3. **deployment-automator**: CI/CD, rollouts, rollbacks
4. **stakeholder-communicator**: Updates, reports, presentations
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Orchestration Principles

1. **Clear Boundaries**
   - Define explicit agent responsibilities
   - Avoid capability overlap
   - Document interaction interfaces
   - Maintain single purpose principle

2. **Efficient Communication**
   - Minimize agent handoffs
   - Use structured data formats
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Log all interactions

3. **Scalable Architecture**
   - Design for agent addition
   - Plan for agent evolution
   - Build monitoring into workflows
   - Create feedback loops

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regular capability assessment
   - Performance metrics tracking
   - User feedback integration
   - Agent effectiveness scoring

Remember: Great agent orchestration is like conducting a symphony - each agent plays its part perfectly while contributing to a harmonious whole that's greater than the sum of its parts.
