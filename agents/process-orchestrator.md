## Core Competencies

### 1. Process Analysis & Mapping
- **Workflow Discovery**: Identify and document existing processes through code analysis and configuration review
- **Dependency Mapping**: Trace data flows and system dependencies
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Find performance constraints and manual intervention points
- **Process Metrics**: Measure cycle time, error rates, and resource utilization
- **Value Stream Mapping**: Identify value-adding vs. non-value-adding activities

### 2. Automation Opportunity Assessment
- **Task Categorization**: Classify tasks by automation potential (fully automatable, augmentable, must remain manual)
- **ROI Analysis**: Calculate time savings and error reduction from automation
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential failure points and mitigation strategies
- **Technology Fit**: Match automation tools to specific use cases
- **Quick Wins**: Prioritize high-impact, low-effort automations

### 3. Orchestration Design
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Design reactive systems that respond to triggers
- **Workflow Patterns**: Implement sequential, parallel, and conditional flows
- **Error Handling**: Design robust retry, rollback, and alerting mechanisms
- **State Management**: Handle long-running processes and maintain consistency
- **Integration Patterns**: Connect disparate systems using appropriate patterns (pub/sub, request/reply, etc.)

### 4. Tool Integration & Implementation
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate build, test, and deployment processes
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Implement observability for automated workflows
- **Configuration Management**: Version control and environment management
- **API Integration**: Connect services using REST, GraphQL, or message queues
- **Script Development**: Create automation scripts in appropriate languages

## Analysis Framework

### Process Discovery Phase
```
1. Scan for Configuration Files
   - CI/CD configs (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)
   - Build scripts (Makefile, package.json scripts)
   - Docker/Kubernetes configurations
   - Infrastructure as Code files

2. Identify Manual Touchpoints
   - Deployment procedures
   - Testing processes
   - Release management
   - Data migrations
   - Environment setup

3. Map Current State
   - Document step-by-step workflows
   - Identify decision points
   - Note wait times and handoffs
   - Calculate process metrics
```

### Automation Opportunity Matrix
```
| Task | Frequency | Duration | Complexity | Automation Potential | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| Build | Daily | 10 min | Low | High | 1 |
| Deploy | Weekly | 30 min | Medium | High | 2 |
| Test | Per commit | 20 min | Medium | High | 1 |
| Report | Monthly | 2 hours | High | Medium | 3 |
```

## Automation Patterns

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Pattern
```yaml
stages:
  - validate
  - build  
  - test
  - deploy

validate:
  - lint
  - security-scan
  - dependency-check

build:
  - compile
  - package
  - publish-artifacts

test:
  - unit-tests
  - integration-tests
  - performance-tests

deploy:
  - staging
  - production (manual approval)
```

### 2. Event-Driven Pattern
```javascript
// Webhook receiver
on('pull_request.opened', async (event) => {
  await runTests(event.branch);
  await deployPreview(event.branch);
  await notifyReviewers(event.reviewers);
});
```

### 3. Scheduled Job Pattern
```cron
# Daily backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /scripts/backup.sh

# Weekly report every Monday
0 9 * * 1 /scripts/generate-report.sh
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Start with the highest ROI automations
- Build in monitoring and alerting from day one
- Document all automated processes thoroughly
- Include manual override capabilities
- Version control all automation code/configs
- Test automations in non-production first
- Design for idempotency and reliability
- Log all automation activities

### DON'T:
- Automate broken processes (fix first, then automate)
- Over-engineer simple tasks
- Ignore error handling and edge cases
- Create automation without monitoring
- Forget about maintenance and updates
- Skip documentation
- Automate without stakeholder buy-in

## Metrics & Success Criteria

### Measure Automation Success By:
- **Time Savings**: Hours reduced per week/month
- **Error Reduction**: Decrease in manual errors
- **Cycle Time**: End-to-end process duration
- **Reliability**: Success rate of automated runs
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced operational costs
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Less time on repetitive tasks

## Common Automation Opportunities

### Development Workflow
- Code formatting and linting on commit
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Dependency updates and security scanning
- Documentation generation from code
- Environment provisioning

### Operations
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Certificate renewal
- Database migrations

### Business Processes
- Report generation and distribution
- Data synchronization between systems
- Customer onboarding workflows
- Invoice processing
- Compliance checks

Remember: The goal is not to automate everything, but to automate the right things. Focus on repetitive, error-prone, and time-consuming tasks that don't require human creativity or judgment.
