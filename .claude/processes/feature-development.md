# Feature Development Process

## Overview
This process outlines the standard workflow for developing new features, from initial planning through implementation and deployment.

## Phases

### 1. Planning Phase
- **Requirements Gathering**
  - Understand user needs and business requirements
  - Define acceptance criteria
  - Identify technical constraints
  
- **Technical Design**
  - Create high-level architecture
  - Identify components to modify/create
  - Plan database changes if needed
  - Consider backward compatibility

- **Task Breakdown**
  - Break feature into manageable tasks
  - Estimate effort for each task
  - Identify dependencies
  - Create development timeline

### 2. Setup Phase
- Create feature branch from main/develop
- Set up development environment
- Install necessary dependencies
- Configure any required services

### 3. Implementation Phase
- **Core Development**
  - Implement functionality incrementally
  - Write code following project standards
  - Regular commits with clear messages
  - Keep changes focused and atomic

- **Testing During Development**
  - Write unit tests alongside code
  - Test locally before committing
  - Verify integration with existing features
  - Check for regressions

### 4. Testing Phase
- **Unit Testing**
  - Ensure all new code has tests
  - Maintain or improve coverage
  - Test edge cases and error conditions

- **Integration Testing**
  - Test interaction with other components
  - Verify API contracts
  - Test database transactions

- **Manual Testing**
  - Test UI/UX if applicable
  - Verify acceptance criteria
  - Exploratory testing for edge cases

### 5. Code Review Phase
- Create pull request with detailed description
- Ensure CI/CD passes
- Address reviewer feedback
- Update tests and documentation as needed

### 6. Documentation Phase
- Update API documentation
- Update user documentation
- Document configuration changes
- Update changelog/release notes

### 7. Deployment Phase
- **Pre-deployment**
  - Review deployment checklist
  - Prepare rollback plan
  - Notify stakeholders

- **Deployment**
  - Deploy to staging first
  - Verify in staging environment
  - Deploy to production
  - Monitor for issues

- **Post-deployment**
  - Verify feature in production
  - Monitor logs and metrics
  - Be ready to rollback if needed
  - Update project documentation

## Best Practices

1. **Incremental Development**
   - Make small, focused changes
   - Deploy frequently
   - Get feedback early

2. **Communication**
   - Regular updates to team
   - Clear commit messages
   - Detailed PR descriptions

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Test-driven development when possible
   - Peer reviews for complex changes
   - Automated testing for regression prevention

4. **Risk Management**
   - Feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - Rollback procedures
